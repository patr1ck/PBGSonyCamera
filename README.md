PBGSonyCamera
=============

This pod provides an interface to Sony cameras that are capable of running the "Smart Remote Control" app. This includes, but is not limited to the NEX-5R/T, NEX-6, A7/A7R, etc.
				   
It does not provide a full API compatibility, but it does a few rudimentary functions including liveview and image capture.

The project state can be considered "Alpha" â€“ While it works, it lacks good documentation. Breaking changes may and likely will occur. I hope you find it helpful, but please don't count on it for anything mission critical.

Bug reports and pull requests happily accepted.
